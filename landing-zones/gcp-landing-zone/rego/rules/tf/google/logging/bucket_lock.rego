A retention policy for a Cloud Storage bucket governs how long objects in the bucket must be retained. Bucket Lock is a feature to permanently restrict edits to the data retention policy. Bucket Lock should be enabled because it preserves activity logs for forensics and security investigations if the system is compromised by an attacker or malicious insider who wants to cover their tracks.",
